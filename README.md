## 💡 Sample Insights

> **💸 Financial Strain Visible in 2023**  
> Enterprises earned $54.68K in revenue, but high operating costs ($40.46K) slashed net profit to just $13.46K which resulting in a thin 24.6% margin

> **🔬 R&D Portfolio Decline**  
> Despite high investments, active R&D projects decreased 40%, indicating a bottleneck in innovation.

> **🚀 Aerospace Shows Lean Efficiency**
> Aerospace division, though smaller in revenue, maintained healthier margins—indicating strong cost and performance management.

## 🎯 Outcome

This project shows how to combine data storytelling, dashboard design, and predictive analysis to deliver boardroom-ready insights, even for a fictional enterprise
Insyra Enterprises is growing in revenue but bleeding efficiency, and unless divisional gaps and rising costs are addressed, long-term profitability remains at risk.
